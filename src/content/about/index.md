  items:
  - title: "Research"
    description: "SNIDDY supports and promotes high-quality research in infectious disease dynamics in or linked to Switzerland, spanning theoretical modeling, data analysis, and real-world applications. By fostering collaboration across disciplines and institutions, the network aims to advance understanding of disease transmission and inform effective public health interventions in Switzerland and beyond."
  
  - title: "Dissemination"
    description: "SNIDDY is committed to the open and timely dissemination of scientific knowledge. Through conferences such as the yearly SMIDDY, workshops, and public engagement, we aim to make infectious disease modeling insights accessible to researchers, decision-makers, and the broader public. Our goal is to enhance transparency, trust, and evidence-based communication during health crises and beyond."
  
  - title: "Support policy"
    description: "SNIDDY engages with policymakers to ensure that scientific evidence informs infectious disease preparedness and response. We provide expert guidance and promote the integration of modeling insights into national and regional health strategies. By maintaining active dialogue with authorities, we help bridge the gap between science and policy."

Since 2010, the local infectious disease modeling
community has held nine editions of the Swiss
Meeting on Infectious Disease Dynamics (SMIDDY).

The Swiss National COVID-19 Science Task Forceâ€™s
Expert Group on Data and Modelling underscored the
critical role of infectious disease modeling in ensuring
pandemic preparedness.

In November 2024, we founded the association Swiss
Network for Infectious Disease Dynamics (SNIDDY)
that aims to promote scientific exchange, research, and
dissemination in the field of infectious disease
dynamics in Switzerland.
